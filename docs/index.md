# Overview

The EDS-Pseudo project aims at detecting identifying entities in clinical documents, and was primarily tested
on clinical reports at AP-HP's Clinical Data Warehouse (EDS).

The model is built on top of [edsnlp](https://github.com/aphp/edsnlp), and consists in a
hybrid model (rule-based + deep learning) for which we provide
rules ([`eds-pseudo/pipes`](https://github.com/aphp/eds-pseudo/tree/main/eds_pseudo/pipes))
and a training recipe [`train.py`](https://github.com/aphp/eds-pseudo/blob/main/scripts/train.py).

We also provide some fictitious
templates ([`templates.txt`](https://github.com/aphp/eds-pseudo/blob/main/data/templates.txt)) and a script to
generate a synthetic
dataset [`generate_dataset.py`](https://github.com/aphp/eds-pseudo/blob/main/scripts/generate_dataset.py).

The entities that are detected are listed below.
