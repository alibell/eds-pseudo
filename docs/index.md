# Overview

EDS-Pseudonymisation is a spaCy project dedicated to the creation of a Named Entity Recognition (NER)
pipeline to extract identifying entities.

## Getting started

EDS-Pseudonymisation is a [spaCy project](https://spacy.io/usage/projects).
We created a single workflow that:

- Partitions the data between train, valid, and test
- Converts the datasets to spaCy format
- Trains the pipeline
- Evaluates the pipeline using the test set

To use it, you will need to supply:

- A labelled dataset
- A HuggingFace transformers model, or use `camembert-base`

In any case, you will need to modify the configuration to reflect these changes.
