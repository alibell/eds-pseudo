# Overview

EDS-Pseudonymisation is a spaCy-based project used at APHP to extract and replace identifying entities
in medical documents.

## Getting started

EDS-Pseudonymisation is a [spaCy project](https://spacy.io/usage/projects).
We created a single workflow that:

- Converts the datasets to spaCy format
- Trains the pipeline
- Evaluates the pipeline using the test set
- Packages the resulting model to make it pip-installable

To use it, you will need to supply:

- A labelled dataset
- A HuggingFace transformers model, or use `camembert-base`

In any case, you will need to modify the configuration to reflect these changes.
